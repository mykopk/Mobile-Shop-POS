                A product is a template for a type of phone, such as a specific model and colour. It holds the details
                and price information, and individual physical phones are added to it as units. For example, one product
                might be a certain model in a certain colour, and every unit of that product is a real phone with its
                own IMEI.

                Setting up your products well makes purchases and sales faster and keeps your records consistent. When

                When you buy new stock, record it under Purchases. You select or create the product, enter how many
                units came in, and add each unit's IMEI. This brings the units into inventory automatically and records
                your cost, which is what makes profit reports possible.

                For extra safety, create a manual backup whenever you make big changes, or at least once a week. Open
                Settings, go to Backup & restore, and choose to create a backup file. Save that file somewhere safe and
                separate from the computer, such as a USB drive or cloud folder.

                If you ever need to recover your data, open Settings, go to Backup & restore and choose the backup file
                to restore from. The app will restore your data from that backup. Be aware that restoring will
                overwrite the current data with the version from the backup.
